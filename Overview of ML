1. Machine Learning in my own words would be when code is able to do something that humans can't do in a reasonable amount of time. For example, searching through
thousands of data to find something specific.

2. The importance of data in machine learning is that without good, clean data, machine learning will not be useful.
The data that we obtain is what is used to be able to get what we want. The better the data is and the more we have
will allow us to make better assumptions. Patterns are also important because that is how the computer is able to 
analyze the organized data and determine if a pattern exists. Patters help the programmer infer the answer to their problem.
Accuracy ties into this as well. If the predictions are not accurate then its just a random guess but with machine learning, we can
minimize the inaccuracy by using many different algorithms.
