Here is a link to all the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

## Assignment 1 - Portfolio
This is the [portfolio](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/bc78af1328941461c93704b88d8313040bd9bed7/Overview%20of%20ML.pdf) assignment. I am not sure if this is the index page or not so I hope I did this right.

## Assignment 2 - Data Exploration
I coded in C++ using Clion to find the mean, median, range, correlation, and covariance of the dataset that was given. The document of my experiance is given [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/Assignment%202.pdf) and my code for this project is given [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/main.cpp)

## Assignment 3 - Linear Models
In this assignment I worked with Meinhard Capucao and we used a quantitative dataset and qualitative dataset to be able to generate a Linear Regression model, a Logistic Regression model, and a Bayes model. 
The dataset for Linear Regression modle can be found [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/diamonds.csv). The notebook for Regression can be found [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/Regression.pdf) along with the code [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/Regression.Rmd)
The dataset for Classification can be found [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/Invistico_Airline.csv). The notebook for the Classification can be found [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/Classification.pdf) and code [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/Classification.Rmd).

## Assignment 4 - ML Algorithm from Scratch
In this assignment I worked with Meinhard Capucao and we used the titantic dataset that was given to us to find the predictions and probabilities using logistic regression and Naive Bayes model. The dataset and code can be found below.
The titanic dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/titanic_project.csv).
The code for Logistic Regression can be found [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/logisticRegression.cpp).
The code for Naive Bayes can be found [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/naiveBayes.cpp).
The Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/ML_Algorithms_from_Scratch.pdf).

## Assignment 5 - Similarity 
In this assignment, I worked in a group with [David Park](https://github.com/d-park7), [Jonathan Ho](https://github.com/JHoGit1), and [David Favela](https://github.com/DavidFavela), and used the diamond and airline data set from Assignment 3 to find the similarities using Linear Regression, Logistic Classification, Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction.
The Diamond Data we used can be found [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/diamonds.csv).
The Airplane Data can be found [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/Invistico_Airline.csv).

## Assignment 6 - Kernel and Ensemble
In this assignment, I worked with Meinhard Capucao and we used 2 different datasets, Diamonds and Credit Card, to find the Linear SVM, Classification SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost. 
The dataset for Diamonds can be found [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/diamonds.csv)
The dataset for Credit Card can be found [here]().
