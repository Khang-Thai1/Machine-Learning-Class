Here is a link to all the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

## Assignment 1 - Portfolio
This is the [portfolio](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/bc78af1328941461c93704b88d8313040bd9bed7/Overview%20of%20ML.pdf) assignment. I am not sure if this is the index page or not so I hope I did this right.

## Assignment 2 - Data Exploration
I coded in C++ using Clion to find the mean, median, range, correlation, and covariance of the dataset that was given. The document of my experiance is given [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/Assignment%202.pdf) and my code for this project is given [here](https://github.com/Khang-Thai1/Machine-Learning-Class/blob/main/main.cpp)

## Assignment 3 - Linear Models
In this assignment I worked with ____ and we used a quantitative dataset and qualitative dataset to be able to generate a Linear Regression model, a Logistic Regression model, and a Bayes model. The dataset for Linear Regression modle can be found here and the dataset for Classification can be found here.
